## Usage

Cleanup TBD. The below doesn't work yet.

### Local Installation

Local installation attempts to mimic Google Colab environment.

Use Python 3.11.12. `pyenv` is a convenient way to do this if you already have another Python version (tutorial: https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/).

Set up your virtual environment by running the following:
Ensure you are on Python 3.11.12 by running `python --version`:
```bash
python --version
# output should be: Python 3.11.12
```
then:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
