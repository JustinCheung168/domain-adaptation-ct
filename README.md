## Contents

- `geirhos/`: Preprocessing & training code for reproducing results from Geirhos et al. (2018).
- `metric_csvs/`: Raw training/validation/test result outputs.
- `src/`: Source code files. Primarily contains sinogram manipulation code right now.
- `*_pipeline*.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebooks used for model training for each experiment on OrganAMNIST data. In our convention expanding on notation used by Geirhos et al., "A" models are trained on single distortions, "C" models are trained on all-but-one distortion, and "D" models are based on Ganin & Lempitsky (2015)'s domain adaptation architecture.
- `GaninDALoss.ipynb`: Quick demonstration that the loss function component used for the label predictor successfully excludes influence of target domain instances.
- `Image_Manipulation*.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebooks for producing distorted data.
- `*resnet*.py`: Classes and script for our custom ResNet-50 configuration based on Ganin & Lempitsky (2015), and for a comparable unmodified ResNet-50.
- `ct_projection_proto.ipynb`: Exploration of sinogram manipulation.
- `evaluate_experiment.ipynb`: Model evaluation code.
- `medmnist_eda.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis of MedMNIST datasets.
- `view_test_results.ipynb`: Model training/validation curve and test matrix visualization code.
